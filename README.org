* citar-org-roam

An emacs package to provide tighter Citar and Org-Roam integration.

** Features

Out-of-box, Citar provides default support for file-per-note bibliographic notes that are compatible with Org-Roam v2.
This package integrates directly with the Org-Roam database, and provides the following additional features to Citar note support:

 1. multiple references per note
 2. multiple reference notes per file
 3. ability to query note citations by reference
 4. "live" updating of Citar UI note presence for references

** Configuration

Activating ~citar-org-roam-mode~ will configure Citar to use these functions.

** Usage

The =citar-open-notes= and =citar-open= commands will work as normal, but will use org-roam to open notes.

To define a sub-file node as a bibliographic note (ref node), use =citar-org-roam-ref-add= to add the ~ROAM_REF~ to the node at point.

Beyond that, the only interactive command this package provides is:

- =citar-org-roam-cited=: presents a list of notes that cite the selected references
